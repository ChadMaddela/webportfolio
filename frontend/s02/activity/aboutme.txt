The decision to join the bootcamp is driven by a desire for a career shift and the pursuit of a long-held dream profession. Recognizing the bootcamp as a strategic way, I am motivated to gain specialized skills swiftly, positioning myself for a successful transition into a fulfilling career aligned with my aspirations.

Experienced in managing end-to-end production processes, I successfully oversaw production schedules, ensuring project progress and delivering weekly updates to the VP of Operations. I skillfully orchestrated relationships with customers, vendors, and subcontractors, while collaborating with the design team to address product design and sourcing issues. Additionally, my role involved daily communication and coordination with the operations team, leading to successful project sign-offs and inspections.
